# Fetu Language

- Nefera Xeperu (Beautiful existence)

Fetu is a modern Ancient Egyptian dialect being developed by KryptoMagick.  The goal of the effort is to create a freely available learning syllabus into Fetu Egyptian.  Presently Fetu is influenced from early and middle Egyptian dialects and was created using source material from many famous Egyptologists of the past as well as influenced from modern researchers.

Where Fetu differs from other Egyptian dialects is primarily in pronounciation.  The written form of Fetu is presently a mixture of standard early and middle Egyptian with a mix of Budge.

Fetu uses the Polish language as the primary "bridge" to allow the language to flow beautifully and naturally off the tongue.
